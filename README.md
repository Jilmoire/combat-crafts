# COMBAT CRAFTS
This mod aims to change the crafting mechanics for combat tools.
This mod will include the following:
  - Semi-realistic weapon crafting system. (Not accurate really...)
  - "Still vanila" way of crafting tools.
  - Longer crafting steps for weapons.

# Questions?
  ### When will this mod release?
First "complete" version of the mod will most likely be pre-released when it's in Alpha: 1.0.0.
  ### What will it change in the game?
Crafting recipes for weapons by adding more steps to craft them.
  ### Will it impact the gameplay heavily?
No, of course not.

### Disclaimer:
This is my very first modding project.
